# MP3-Tag-Reader-And-Editor
MP3 Tag Reader and Editor is a C-based command-line tool for viewing and editing ID3v2.3 tags in MP3 files. It reads files in binary mode, locates metadata frames, and updates or displays info like title, artist, album, and genre. Edits create a temp copy to preserve the original file structure.
